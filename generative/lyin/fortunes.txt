You are, therefore you are.
Never look a tree in its mouth.
Don’t put all your feet in the same basket.
Better boustrophedon than never.
Don’t count your chickens before they’ve osmosed.
Every cloud has beige lining.
When life gives you lemons, do not eat them.
A watched pot never gets impeached.
All that glitters is glitter.
Beauty is in the eye of the scapula.
Actions speak louder than mice.
Two wrongs don’t make a streaming service.
